This research was conducted by [Sean Boots](https://sboots.ca/), [Prof. Amanda Clarke](https://amandaclarke.ca/), [Anne Lajoie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemichelelajoie/), and [Chantal Brousseau](https://chantalbrousseau.xyz/) from the [School of Public Policy and Administration](https://carleton.ca/sppa/) and the [Data Science and Analytics program at Carleton University](https://graduate.carleton.ca/cu-programs/data-science-and-analytics/). It expands on [an earlier Ottawa Civic Tech project](https://goc-spending.github.io/about/) from 2017-2019 and was made possible by funding from the [Government of Ontarioâ€™s Early Researcher Award program](https://research.carleton.ca/story/moving-fast-and-breaking-public-trust-how-digital-reforms-in-government-must-be-more-accountable-to-citizens/) and the support of the [Canada School of Public Service](https://csps-efpc.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx) [Public Servant-in-Residence](https://sboots.ca/2022/03/16/joining-carleton-university-as-a-public-servant-in-residence/) program.
