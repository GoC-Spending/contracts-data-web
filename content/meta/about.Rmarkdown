This research was conducted by [Sean Boots](https://sboots.ca/), [Prof. Amanda Clarke](https://amandaclarke.ca/), [Anne Lajoie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemichelelajoie/), and [Chantal Brousseau](https://chantalbrousseau.xyz/) from the [School of Public Policy and Administration at Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/sppa/). It expands on [an earlier Ottawa Civic Tech project](https://goc-spending.github.io/about/) from 2017-2019. 

The source code [for the data analysis](https://github.com/goc-Spending/contracts-data) and [for the website repository](https://github.com/goc-Spending/contracts-data-web) is available on GitHub. Both repositories are licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/GoC-Spending/contracts-data/blob/main/LICENSE). Source data from [open.canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/en) is available under the [Open Government Licence â€“ Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada), and [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start) data used for inflation adjustments is available under the [Statistics Canada Open Licence](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/reference/licence) ([see additional license details](https://github.com/mountainMath/cansim#license)).

This website was built using the [Blogdown package](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/) and is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). [See additional website details](/methodology/#website-display). If you have suggested improvements or corrections, please [send in your comments and feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHGzAQMaOkj4OD2Kc8Gw4ROChOfx6MKm5t2CSr6R4U2qupBQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.739845506=%2Fabout%2F)!

This data is provided as-is, and no guarantees are made for the accuracy of the data or the processes used to aggregate and analyze it. **Trends and total values should be considered estimates rather than precise values.** [See the methodology page for more details](/methodology/#calculate-spending-over-time).
